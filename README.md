This is a repo of all the code I will write for the class, my code will be more advanced then what she expects of you, so use it sparingly. As the circuits get more advanced I will create schematics of the wiring.
If you want to be nice, you can always bring me a white monster for my work. I normaly only get 3 hours of sleep a night, so there might be some bugs, let me know if you find any. Lastly, you can share this with anyone except Colin Willms.
